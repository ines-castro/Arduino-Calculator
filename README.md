# Arduino Calculator
This repository contains the learning materials for a hub where kids and teens (12–18) build their own calculator using Arduino, covering electronics, coding, and hands-on robotics skills.

This repository is divided into three main folders:

- **3D:** Contains files for 3D printing the calculator case. These parts are used to enclose the electronic components and turn the project into a physical calculator.

- **Electronics:** Includes datasheets and test files to help verify that the electronic components are correctly assembled and wired.

- **Programming:** Contains the Arduino code that makes the calculator work. The code is divided into different difficulty levels, higher levels add more features and require more advanced programming skills.
